# Speech to text

This simple [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)-based application showcases the effective utilization of the [Google's Speech-to-Text service](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text). It takes what the user speaks into their device's microphone and transcribes it into written text, which is then displayed on the screen.

## Technology Stack

The application has been generated by [Nx](https://nx.dev), a fast and extensible dev tool and is built on [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/). [Angular](https://angular.io/) provides versatile choices for robust frontend development, whereas [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) ensures a scalable and efficient build of the backend.

## Functionality

Upon initiating the application, the user is prompted with a simplistic interface where they can start speaking. The backend harnesses the power of [Google's Speech-to-Text service](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text) "under the hood" to transcribe this spoken language into written text. The transcribed text is then promptly displayed on the screen.

> Note: The backend for this app is deployed on [Render.com](https://render.com/) - free hosting service. Please keep in mind that the initial usage may take a little longer (even 2 minutes!) due to Render.com's [Spinning down on idle](https://docs.render.com/free#spinning-down-on-idle) feature, which temporarily turns down free web services after 15 minutes of inactivity. However, the app should respond much faster in subsequent uses.
